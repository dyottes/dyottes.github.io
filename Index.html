<h2>Professional Summary</h2>
<div class="ProSum">
<p>Computer Support Technician with fantastic User/Customer support skills.  15 years  of computer support experience and I have not forgotten what it is like to be someone who doesn't have the experience on computers that I do. This comes in handy when dealing with the average user.  When someone's computer stops working like it should, it is frustrating and stressful.  I try to put a user at ease with humor, and by not talking over their heads in computer techno-babble.
