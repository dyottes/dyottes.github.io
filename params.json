This comes in handy when dealing with the average user.  When someone's computer stops working like it should, it is frustrating and stressful.  I try to put a user at ease with humor, and by not talking over their heads in computer techno-babble.\r\n</div>\r\n</p>\r\n<div class=\"TheRest\">\r\n\r\n<h2>Education</h2>\r\n\r\n  \r\n    <h4>Alexandria Technical College (Alexandria, MN) - 1995-1997</h4>\r\n  \r\n    <ul>\r\n      <li>Associates in Applied Science degree, Computer and Voice Networking, 1997</li>\r\n      \r\n    </ul>\r\n    \r\n    <h4>Century College (Maplewood, Mn), </h4>\r\n\r\n    <ul>\r\n   \r\n    <li>Introduction to Networking, 04/18 - 06/08/2012</li>\r\n    <li>Introduction to PC Security, 04/18 - 06/08/2012</li>\r\n    <li>Advanced PC Security, 6/20 - 08/10/2012</li>\r\n    <li>Introduction to PC Troubleshooting, 10/17 - 12/7/2012</li>\r\n    <li>Wireless Networking, 10/17 - 12/7/2012</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n</ul>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h2>Certifications</h2>\r\n<ul>\r\n  <li>Received certification from HP in desktop and laptop hardware repair.
